## Project Description 

Crave is an app that helps the user generate a random meal and drink combo so that they donâ€™t have to decide on one. The app requires users to register first, then log in. Then they come to the home page where they can shuffle a meal & drink combo by pressing a button. Doing this adds the combo to their combo board. In the combo board the user has the option to delete a combo, get more info on the combo, and add it to favorites.
